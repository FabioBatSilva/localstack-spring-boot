/**
 * LocalStackApplicationListener is responsible for starting the LocalStack service
 * on startup and on shutdown it's responsible for shutting down the service.
 *
 * The startup is made possible by implementing the BeanPostProcessor interface, because for this library
 * it's critical to start the LocalStackService as soon as possible. The BeanPostProcessor interface allows
 * us to start the service during the first bean creations.
 *
 * The shutdown is made possible by implementing the ApplicationListener<ContextClosedEvent> interface, so
 * the callback method will be called once the application is shutting down.
